 What is hoisting? 
  In the JS compiler, "hoisted" variables are lifted to the top of the scope they are declared in. When using var, you can access the variable name and its undefined value before it is used later on in the code. 
  
  Function declarations are also hoisted and can be used before they are defined in the code.
